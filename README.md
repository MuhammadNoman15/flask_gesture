# AI-Based Gesture Animation for Sign Language Avatars

This project implements a deep learning-based system for generating realistic hand gesture animations for sign language avatars. The system uses computer vision and machine learning techniques to track hand movements, recognize sign language gestures, and synthesize smooth animations.

## Features

- Real-time hand tracking using MediaPipe
- Deep learning-based gesture recognition
- Smooth animation synthesis for sign language gestures
- Support for ASL (American Sign Language) gestures
- Real-time avatar animation rendering

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/avatar.git
cd avatar
```

2. Create a virtual environment (recommended):
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Training the Model

1. Prepare your dataset:
```bash
python src/utils/prepare_dataset.py --dataset_path /path/to/dataset
```

2. Train the gesture recognition model:
```bash
python training/train_gesture_model.py --config config/training_config.yaml
```

### Running the Animation System

1. Start the hand tracking and animation system:
```bash
python src/main.py --model_path models/gesture_model.pth
```

## Model Architecture

The system consists of three main components:

1. **Hand Tracking Module**: Uses MediaPipe for real-time hand pose estimation
2. **Gesture Recognition Model**: Deep learning model for sign language gesture recognition
3. **Animation Synthesis**: Generates smooth animations based on recognized gestures

## Dataset

The system can be trained on various sign language datasets:
- RWTH-PHOENIX-Weather
- ASL Lexicon
- Custom datasets
